Wiki Quiz App 
Objective 
Build a Frontend UI and an API in Python (FastAPI/Django) that accepts a Wikipedia article URL as input and automatically generates a quiz based on the article content using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system should have two tabs: 
TAB 1 – GENERATE QUIZ 
1. User provides a Wikipedia article URL (for example: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). 
2. The backend should: 
○ Scrape the page content using a library such as BeautifulSoup 
3. Send the extracted text to an LLM (Gemini free tier API or any other free tier API via LangChain) to: 
○ Generate a quiz (5–10 questions) containing: 
• Question text 
• Four options (A–D) 
• Correct answer 
• Short explanation
• Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) 
○ Suggest related Wikipedia topics for further reading. 
4. Store all scraped and generated data in a PostgreSQL database. 
5. The API should return JSON containing the extracted and generated information. 
The frontend should display this neatly in a structured, card-based layout. 
SAMPLE API OUTPUT 
{ 
“id” : 1, 
"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing", 
"title": "Alan Turing", 
"summary": "Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist...", "key_entities": { 
"people": ["Alan Turing", "Alonzo Church"], 
"organizations": ["University of Cambridge", "Bletchley Park"], 
"locations": ["United Kingdom"] 
}, 
"sections": ["Early life", "World War II", "Legacy"], 
"quiz": [ 
{ 
"question": "Where did Alan Turing study?", 
"options": [ 
"Harvard University", 
"Cambridge University", 
"Oxford University", 
"Princeton University" 
],
"answer": "Cambridge University", 
"difficulty": "easy", 
"explanation": "Mentioned in the 'Early life' section." 
}, 
{ 
"question": "What was Alan Turing’s main contribution during World War II?", "options": [ 
"Atomic research", 
"Breaking the Enigma code", 
"Inventing radar", 
"Developing jet engines" 
], 
"answer": "Breaking the Enigma code", 
"difficulty": "medium", 
"explanation": "Detailed in the 'World War II' section." 
} 
], 
"related_topics": ["Cryptography", "Enigma machine", "Computer science history"] } 
TAB 2 – PAST QUIZZES (HISTORY) 
1. Display a table listing all previously processed Wikipedia URLs stored in the database. 
2. Clicking “Details” should open a modal displaying the full quiz in the same structured layout as Tab 1. 
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS 
● Clean, minimal UI (React, Vue, or simple HTML acceptable)
● Tab 1: 
URL input field 
“Generate Quiz” button 
Structured display of quiz and related topics 
● Tab 2: 
Table of historical quizzes 
“Details” modal reused from Tab 1 
● Optional: Implement a “Take Quiz” mode (answers hidden until submitted) 
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
● Backend: FastAPI / Django 
● Database: PostgreSQL 
● Frontend: React or minimal HTML 
● LLM: Gemini or any free tier API via LangChain 
● Scraping: BeautifulSoup 
● Data source: Wikipedia article URLs (HTML scraping only, no Wikipedia API) 
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
1. Complete working code for backend and frontend. 
2. Screenshots of: 
○ Quiz generation page (Tab 1) 
○ History view (Tab 2) 
○ Details modal 
3. “sample_data/” folder containing: 
○ Example Wikipedia URLs tested 
○ Corresponding JSON API outputs 
4. README file explaining setup, endpoints, and testing steps.
5. Include the LangChain prompt templates used for quiz and related-topic generation. 
EVALUATION CRITERIA 
Category Description 

Prompt Design & Optimization 
Effectiveness and clarity of prompts used for quiz generation, grounding of outputs in article content, and minimization of hallucination. 

Quiz Quality Relevance, diversity, factual correctness, and appropriate difficulty levels of generated questions. 
Extraction Quality Clean scraping and accurate extraction of key sections, summary, and entities. 
Functionality End-to-end flow: accepts URL, scrapes, generates quiz, and stores in database. 
Code Quality Modular, readable, and logically structured code with meaningful comments. 
Error Handling Handles invalid URLs, network errors, or missing sections gracefully. 
UI Design Clear, minimal, and visually organized layout; both tabs functional. 

Database Accuracy 
Data is correctly stored and retrievable in history view. 

Testing Evidence Sample data and screenshots demonstrate system robustness and variety. 
BONUS POINTS
● “Take Quiz” mode with user scoring. 
● URL validation and preview (auto-fetch article title before processing). ● Store scraped raw HTML in database for reference. 
● Caching to prevent duplicate scraping of the same URL. ● Section-wise question grouping in UI.
